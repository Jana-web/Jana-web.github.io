Why more or less everything is fine
		  <p class="notbold">Happy is a book by <u>Derren Brown</u>.
		  <br>"Everyone says they want to be happy. 
		  But that's much more easily said than done.
		  What does heppy actually mean? And how do you even know when you feel it?"
		  <br>
		  <center class="notbold">What I enjoyed about this book that it is not your stereotypical 5 steps to happiness book.
 It goes deep into exploring the meaning of the happiness. My favourite chapter in the book is actually the one looking at the history of the happiness. It talks about what Greek philosophers thought happiness means and how later church has influenced the way we understand what happiness is.
 What I will take away from this book is that nobody needs to feel happy all the time. But being unhappy is also a choice.
 I would definitely recommend this book to people who enjoy psychology, people who like discovering something new about themselves and would like to reevaluate their lives.</center>

		  <h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Room-Novel-Emma-Donoghue/dp/0316098337"> Room</a></h2>
		  by Emma Donoghue
		  <p class="notbold"> "To five-year-old Jack, Room is the entire world. 
		  It is where he was born and grew up; it's where he lives with his Ma as they learn and read and eat and sleep and play. 
		  At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits."
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  This book makes you see the world from the five-year-old Jack's point of view.
		  Jack is too young to understand that there is a big world outside the room he was born in. 
		  He does not feel trapped like his mother does. 
		  He feels happy, and he loves his mother and the daily routine they have. 
		  This sense of seeing the world with his eyes, yet understanding more than he does is a phenomenal sensation. 
		 When I was reading the book it felt like I was in the room yet I could not help nor Jack nor his mother. 
		  I would recommend this book to people who feel the need to see that there is always a hope even when it looks like nothing will ever be okay.

		  <h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Games-Book/dp/0439023483">The Hunger Games</a></h2>
		  by Suzanne Collins
		  	<p class="notbold">
"Winning means fame and fortune. Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun. . . ."
<br>
<br>
The book is breathtaking. 
From the moment you get to know Katniss Everdeen and her district till her last choice on the battlefield ring.
 The book is a thriller in every way possible or just thrilling :D.
 When you are reading this book it feels as if you’re watching a movie in your head. 
 Author is really good at describing the scenery, and also feelings of Katniss.
 There will be times when you will want to cry, that’s for sure. 
 Recommending to people who love reading novels that are set in imagined scenarios that make you evaluate the system we are living in now.
